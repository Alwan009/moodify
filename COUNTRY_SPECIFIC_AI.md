# Country-Specific AI Recommendations for Moodify

This document explains the improvements made to ensure Gemini AI provides country-specific music recommendations.

## The Challenge

When using AI to generate music recommendations, there's a tendency for the model to default to popular Western music, even when a specific country is requested. This is because:

1. The AI model has more training data on popular Western music
2. Some countries may have limited representation in certain music genres
3. The AI might prioritize the mood and genre over the country requirement

## Our Solution

We've implemented several improvements to ensure the AI provides authentic country-specific music recommendations:

### 1. Enhanced Prompting

We've updated the prompts sent to Gemini AI to strongly emphasize the country requirement:

```javascript
const prompt = `I need YouTube video IDs for ${mood} ${musicType} music specifically from ${country}.
It's VERY IMPORTANT that all songs must be by artists from ${country} or in the language/style of ${country}.
The country requirement is the highest priority - all results MUST be authentic ${country} music.
Please provide 5 great examples.`;
```

The prompt now:
- Explicitly states that the country requirement is the highest priority
- Asks for songs by artists from the specific country
- Requests music in the language or style of the country

### 2. Detailed Instructions

We've added more detailed instructions in the API request:

```javascript
IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. All songs MUST be by artists from ${country} or in the language/style of ${country}
2. The songs should match the ${mood} mood and ${musicType} genre
3. If you cannot find exact matches, prioritize the country requirement first
```

These instructions help the AI understand that if it can't find an exact match for all criteria, it should prioritize the country requirement over the mood or genre.

### 3. User Feedback Mechanism

We've added a feedback mechanism that allows users to request different recommendations if they notice that the results don't match the country:

- A notice informs users to click the feedback button if recommendations don't match the country
- The "Get Different Recommendations" button triggers a new AI request with even stronger emphasis on the country requirement
- The second request uses more forceful language to ensure country-specific results

### 4. Enhanced Display

We've improved how recommendations are displayed:

- Each video now shows its title and description
- The description explains why the song matches the request, including how it relates to the selected country
- An AI badge clearly indicates which country's music is being recommended

## Future Improvements

To further enhance country-specific recommendations:

1. **Pre-filtering**: Create a database of known artists by country to verify AI recommendations
2. **User Feedback Collection**: Store user feedback on incorrect recommendations to improve future results
3. **Country-Specific Prompts**: Develop specialized prompts for countries with unique musical traditions
4. **Fallback Options**: If no exact matches are found, offer users alternative options (e.g., similar countries or related genres)

## Testing

When testing country-specific recommendations, try various combinations:

- Countries with distinct musical traditions (Morocco, Japan, Brazil)
- Less common genre/country combinations (e.g., Metal music from Thailand)
- Moods that might be expressed differently across cultures

If you encounter any issues with country-specific recommendations, please report them so we can continue to improve the AI's accuracy.
