# Playlist Fix for Moodify

I've fixed the issue where some music type combinations show "no playlists found". Here are the changes I made:

## 1. Added Fallback Logic

Updated the `displayPlaylist` function to try multiple fallback options:

1. First, it tries to find an exact match for the mood, music type, and country
2. If that fails, it tries the same mood and music type but with USA as the country
3. If that fails, it tries the same mood and country but with pop as the music type
4. If that fails, it tries the mood with pop music type and USA country
5. Only if all of these fail does it show the "no results" message

## 2. Added More Playlist Combinations

Added many more playlist combinations to cover more mood, music type, and country combinations:
- Added all music types for each mood with USA as the country
- Added more country options for popular music types
- Ensured every mood has at least one playlist for each music type

## 3. Updated the "No Results" Message

Made the "no results" message more helpful by suggesting popular combinations that are guaranteed to work.

## 4. Version Update

Updated the version number to ensure the changes are applied and not cached by browsers.

These changes ensure that users will almost always get playlist recommendations, even if they choose uncommon combinations.
